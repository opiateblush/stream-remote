# Stream Remote

This is a custom app for [OVR Toolkit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1068820/OVR_Toolkit/) that allows you to manage some things of your streaming software directly in VR. Currently, the only supported software is [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). Streamlabs is not supported.

## Project Structure

The whole repository is hosted on GitHub Pages and resembles the webapp itself. So everything that is pushed onto the main branch is going to be live in an instant. This way, the webapp doesn't have to be hosted somewhere else and downtime is minimized.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute to this project, please feel free to open up a pull request or an issue. I'd be happy if someone carries on even if the codebase is somewhat messy.
